# 4.2. Writing a Package

 - [4.2.1. Setting up the Package](#settingup)
 - [4.2.2. Adding a Class](#class)
 - [4.2.3. Connecting with the Controller](#controller)

The framework of **Cradle** is all about packages and there are three types of
packages *(but they basically can do the same thing, just located in different
places)*.

 - **Root packages** - are found in your project root directory. All applications as in
`/app/admin`, `/app/www` and modules as in `/module/utility` are all kinds of root
packages.
 - **Vendor packages** - are found in the `/vendor/` folder of your project directory.
These packages are from third party vendors. `/vendor/cradlephp/cradle-system`,
`/vendor/cradlephp/cradle-profile`, `/vendor/cradlephp/cradle-auth` are all
kinds of vendor packages.
 - **Pseudo packages** - are located in memory. It does not have any files or folders.
The `global` package is an example of a pseudo package.

## 4.2.1. Setting up the Package

This chapter continues from the last chapter,
[4.1. Developing the Front End](./4.1.-Developing-the-Front-End.html) and in
this chapter we will create an **Article Package** from the ground up. Create a
file called `/module/article/.cradle.php`, where the `/module` should already
exist and add the following PHP code. This will be called the **Article Bootstrap**.

###### Figure 4.2.1.A. Setting up the bootstrap
```php
require_once __DIR__ . '/src/events.php';
```

```warning
WARNING: Don't forget the `<?php` tag
```

Next, create the **Article Events** at `/module/article/src/events.php` and add
the following PHP code.

###### Figure 4.2.1.B. Writing an Event
```php
use Cradle\Storm\SqlFactory;

$this->on('article-detail', function($req, $res) {
    //get the article ID
    $articleId = $req->getStage('article_id');

    //if it is not a number
    if (!is_numeric($articleId)) {
        //set an error and return
        return $res->setError(true, 'Invalid ID');
    }

    //get the PDO object from services
    $pdo = $this->package('global')->service('sql-main');
    //load up Storm ORM
    $database = SqlFactory::load($pdo);

    //get the article
    $article = $database
        ->search('article')
        ->innerJoinUsing('article_profile', 'article_id')
        ->innerJoinUsing('profile', 'profile_id')
        ->filterByArticleId($articleId)
        ->getRow();

    //if no article found
    if (!$article) {
        //set an error and return
        return $res->setError(true, 'Not Found');
    }

    //set the results
    $res->setResults($article);
});
```

The goal of this event `article-detail` is to produce the information of an
**Article Object**, given its `article_id`. If the ID is invalid or the database
can't find it, the event should set an error. There are a few concepts in the
above example that need to be explained.

First if there is no `article_id`, we can set an error via
`$res->setError(true, 'Invalid ID')`. Since we should not do anything on an
invalid ID we should simply return.

We can access a service in our config via `$this->package('global')->service('sql-main');`,
which we cover in [3.1. Services &amp; Settings](./3.1.-Services-&-Settings.html).
In this case `sql-main` returns a **PDO** object. We pass this **PDO** object to
`SqlFactory::load($pdo)` to load up the [Storm ORM](#), and then from here get
the article from the database.

Before we can test this event, we need to register this package in the
configuration. Open `/config/packages.php` and add the **Article Package** to
the bottom of the list just like the following example.

###### Figure 4.2.1.C. Registering the Package
```php
return array (
  ...
  '/module/article' =>
  array (
    'active' => true,
  ),
);

```

To test this event in terminal, go to the root directory of your project and
execute the following bash command.

###### Figure 4.2.1.D. Testing the Package
```bash
$ bin/cradle article-detail article_id=1
```

```json
{"results":{"profile_id":"1","article_id":"1","article_title":"What is the Fate of the Furious?","article_detail":"I don't understand if <b>Jason Stathom<\/b> killed <b>Sung Kang<\/b>, <i>(<b>Vin Desiel's<\/b> asian friend).&nbsp;<\/i>How could they be cool with each other in future \"<b>Fast and Furious\"<\/b> films?","article_status":"published","article_published":"2019-01-30 14:00:00","article_active":"1","article_created":"2019-01-25 13:27:18","article_updated":"2019-01-28 07:11:57","article_references":"{\"reference_link\": \"https:\/\/ew.com\/movies\/2017\/04\/15\/fate-furious-han-shaw-chris-morgan\/\", \"reference_quote\": \"Statham actually joined the franchise at the end of Fast & Furious 6, when it was revealed that he killed longtime Toretto crew member Han (Sung Kang) as the first step of his vengeance mission.\", \"reference_title\": \"The Fate of the Furious: Screenwriter Chris Morgan talks Shaw... and Han\", \"reference_publication\": \"Entertainment Weekly\"}","profile_name":"John Doe","profile_active":"1","profile_created":"2019-01-20 06:43:42","profile_updated":"2019-01-20 06:43:42"}}
```

The next thing we probably want to do is add the **Article Object**'s comments
to the result set. Lets go back to the **Article Events**
*(`/module/article/src/events.php`)* and add another SQL query like the
following code snippet.

###### Figure 4.2.1.E. Adding Comments
```php
...
$this->on('article-detail', function($req, $res) {
    //get the article ID
    $articleId = $req->getStage('article_id');

    ...

    //get all the article comments
    $comments = $database
        ->search('comment')
        ->innerJoinUsing('comment_profile', 'comment_id')
        ->innerJoinUsing('profile', 'profile_id')
        ->innerJoinUsing('article_comment', 'comment_id')
        ->filterByArticleId($articleId)
        ->getRows();

    //if there are comments
    if (!empty($comments)) {
        //add the comments
        $article['comment'] = $comments;
    }

    //set the results
    $res->setResults($article);
});
```

If you run the command line test again `bin/cradle article-detail article_id=1`,
you will see the comments have been added. The above example is kind of how the
event [`system-model-detail`](#) works and we could just call `system-model-detail`
instead of writing this.

While the system can deal with basic relations, the limitations is that it only
cases for one level deep. What that means is, the system can auto-determine
`article->comment` and `comment->comment` but it doesn't case for
`article->comment->comment`. In the case of our example, it would make sense to
write a custom event like `article-detail` to achieve the `article->comment->comment`
result set.

In the **Article Events** *(`/module/article/src/events.php`)* let's change the code
inside of `if (!empty($comments))` with the following code.

###### Figure 4.2.1.F. Adding More Comments
```php
...
$this->on('article-detail', function($req, $res) {
    ...
    //if there are comments
    if (!empty($comments)) {
        $commentIds = [];
        $commentsWithChildren = [];

        //loop through the comments
        foreach($comments as $comment) {
            $commentId = $comment['comment_id'];
            //add to the ID set
            $commentIds[] = $commentId;
            //organize the comments by ID
            $commentsWithChildren[$commentId] = $comment;
        }

        //set up the SQL IN filter
        $filter = sprintf(
            'comment_id_1 IN (%s)',
            implode(',', $commentIds)
        );

        //get all the sub comments in 1 query
        $subcomments = $database
            ->search('comment')
            ->innerJoinOn('comment_comment', 'comment_id_2=comment_id')
            ->innerJoinUsing('comment_profile', 'comment_id')
            ->innerJoinUsing('profile', 'profile_id')
            ->addFilter($filter)
            ->getRows();

        //loop through each sub comment
        foreach ($subcomments as $comment) {
            $primaryCommentId = $comment['comment_id_1'];
            $secondaryCommentId = $comment['comment_id_2'];

            //attach it to the existing comments as children
            $primaryComment = $commentsWithChildren[$primaryCommentId];
            $primaryComment['children'][$secondaryCommentId] = $comment;
            $commentsWithChildren[$primaryCommentId] = $primaryComment;
        }

        //add the comments
        $article['comment'] = $commentsWithChildren;
    }

    //set the results
    $res->setResults($article);
});
```

Our `article-detail` event in all of its glory should look like the following code.

```php
$this->on('article-detail', function($req, $res) {
    $articleId = $req->getStage('article_id');

    if (!is_numeric($articleId)) {
        return $res->setError(true, 'Invalid ID');
    }

    $pdo = $this->package('global')->service('sql-main');
    $database = SqlFactory::load($pdo);

    $article = $database
        ->search('article')
        ->innerJoinUsing('article_profile', 'article_id')
        ->innerJoinUsing('profile', 'profile_id')
        ->filterByArticleId($articleId)
        ->getRow();

    if (!$article) {
        return $res->setError(true, 'Not Found');
    }

    $comments = $database
        ->search('comment')
        ->innerJoinUsing('comment_profile', 'comment_id')
        ->innerJoinUsing('profile', 'profile_id')
        ->innerJoinUsing('article_comment', 'comment_id')
        ->filterByArticleId($articleId)
        ->getRows();

    if (empty($comments)) {
        return $res->setResults($article);
    }

    $commentIds = [];
    $commentsWithChildren = [];

    foreach($comments as $comment) {
        $commentId = $comment['comment_id'];
        $commentIds[] = $commentId;
        $commentsWithChildren[$commentId] = $comment;
    }

    $filter = sprintf(
        'comment_id_1 IN (%s)',
        implode(',', $commentIds)
    );

    $subcomments = $database
        ->search('comment')
        ->innerJoinOn('comment_comment', 'comment_id_2=comment_id')
        ->innerJoinUsing('comment_profile', 'comment_id')
        ->innerJoinUsing('profile', 'profile_id')
        ->addFilter($filter)
        ->getRows();

    foreach ($subcomments as $comment) {
        $primaryCommentId = $comment['comment_id_1'];
        $secondaryCommentId = $comment['comment_id_2'];

        $primaryComment = $commentsWithChildren[$primaryCommentId];
        $primaryComment['children'][$secondaryCommentId] = $comment;
        $commentsWithChildren[$primaryCommentId] = $primaryComment;
    }

    $article['comment'] = $commentsWithChildren;

    $res->setResults($article);
});
```

While this would probably work in all cases, as programmers we should also be
thinking about abstraction. In the **Article Package** we are working on, let's
add a class called **SqlService** to abstract out the SQL calls.

<a name="class"></a>
## 4.2.2. Adding a Class

Before we can do that, we need to tell *Composer* about the new
**Article Name Space** by registering it in  `/composer.json` like the following
json code.

###### Figure 4.2.2.A. composer.json
```json
{
    ...
    "autoload": {
        "psr-4": {
            "Cradle\\Module\\Utility\\": "module/utility/src/",
            "Cradle\\Module\\Article\\": "module/article/src/"
        }
    },
    ...
}
```

Next in terminal, we need to issue the following *Composer* command to rebuild its
list of name space locations.

###### Figure 4.2.2.B. Dump Autoload
```bash
$ composer dump-autoload
```

Let's next create the **SqlService** at `/module/article/src/SqlService.php` and
paste the following code.

###### Figure 4.2.2.B SqlService
```php
namespace Cradle\Module\Article;

use Cradle\Storm\SqlFactory;
use PDO as SqlResource;

class SqlService
{
    protected $resource;

    public function __construct(SqlResource $resource)
    {
        //load up Storm ORM
        $this->resource = SqlFactory::load($resource);
    }

    public function addChildrenComments(array $comments): array
    {
        //if no comments
        if (empty($comments)) {
            //return the comments as is
            return $comments;
        }

        $commentIds = [];
        $commentsWithChildren = [];

        //loop through the comments
        foreach($comments as $comment) {
            $commentId = $comment['comment_id'];
            //add to the ID set
            $commentIds[] = $commentId;
            //organize the comments by ID
            $commentsWithChildren[$commentId] = $comment;
        }

        //set up the SQL IN filter
        $filter = sprintf(
            'comment_id_1 IN (%s)',
            implode(',', $commentIds)
        );

        //get all the sub comments in 1 query
        $subcomments = $this->resource
            ->search('comment')
            ->innerJoinOn('comment_comment', 'comment_id_2=comment_id')
            ->innerJoinUsing('comment_profile', 'comment_id')
            ->innerJoinUsing('profile', 'profile_id')
            ->addFilter($filter)
            ->getRows();

        //loop through each sub comment
        foreach ($subcomments as $comment) {
            $primaryCommentId = $comment['comment_id_1'];
            $secondaryCommentId = $comment['comment_id_2'];

            //attach it to the existing comments as children
            $primaryComment = $commentsWithChildren[$primaryCommentId];
            $primaryComment['children'][$secondaryCommentId] = $comment;
            $commentsWithChildren[$primaryCommentId] = $primaryComment;
        }

        //return the new array
        return $commentsWithChildren;
    }
}
```

So first, we created a namespace called `Cradle\Module\Article` in both the
`/composer.json` and in `/module/article/src/SqlService.php`. We then copied the
namespace `use Cradle\Storm\SqlFactory` from the **Article Events**
*(`/module/article/src/events.php`)* as well as added an alias for **PDO**
described via `use PDO as SqlResource`. We did this in order to require the
**PDO** object in our construct that looks like
`public function __construct(SqlResource $resource)`. Then we created a public
method called `addChildrenComments()` where the body of that method, we copied from
the **Article Events**.

We can now abstract parts out from the `article-detail` like the following code.

###### Figure 4.2.2.B Event Abstraction
```php
use Cradle\Module\Article\SqlService;

$this->on('article-detail', function($req, $res) {
    //call the model detail event
    $req->setStage('schema', 'article');
    $this->trigger('system-model-detail', $req, $res);

    //if there is an error
    if ($res->isError()) {
        //there's nothing else to do
        return;
    }

    //get the articles
    $article = $res->getResults();

    //load up the SqlService Class
    $pdo = $this->package('global')->service('sql-main');
    $database = new SqlService($pdo);

    //add the comment children
    $article['comment'] = $database->addChildrenComments($article['comment']);

    //set the results
    $res->setResults($article);
});
```

As you noticed, we re-used `system-model-detail` instead of our original code to
get the **Article Object** and **Comment Objects**. We finally called our new
`SqlService->addChildrenComments()` to add the additional `comment->comment`
result set. Let's test this one more time on our command line to make sure
everything still works.

###### Figure 4.2.2.C. Testing the Package
```bash
$ bin/cradle article-detail article_id=1
```

So now that we have the capabilities to retrieve an `article->comment->comment`
result set, let's use our new **Article Package** in the [front end](#).
Go to the **Article Controller** *(`/app/www/src/controller/article.php`)* and
replace the code calling `system-model-detail` with our new `article-detail`
instead. The following shows how it should have been done.

<a name="controller"></a>
## 4.2.3. Connecting with the Controller

###### Figure 4.2.3.A. Article Controller
```php
$this->get('/article/:article_id', function($req, $res) {
    $data = [];
    //if this is a return back from processing the comment form
    if ($req->hasPost()) {
        $data['form'] = $res->getPost();
    }

    //and it's has of an error
    if ($res->isError()) {
        //pass the error messages to the template
        $res->setFlash($res->getMessage(), 'error');
        $data['errors'] = $res->getValidation();
    }

    //get the article
    $this->trigger('article-detail', $req, $res);

    //if there is no data
    if (!$res->hasResults()) {
        //let the 404 catch this
        return;
    }
    ...
});
```

Lastly, let's go in to the Article Detail Template
*(`/app/www/src/template/article/detail.html`)* and add the following
`{% raw %}{{#if children}}{% endraw %}` case.

###### Figure 4.2.3.B. Article Detail Template
```html
<div class="container">
    ...
    <h3 class="mt-5">Comments</h3>
    {% raw %}{{#each item.comment}}{% endraw %}
        ...
        {% raw %}{{#if children}}{% endraw %}
            {% raw %}{{#each children}}{% endraw %}
                <div class="ml-5 mt-3">
                    <p>{% raw %}{{profile_name}}{% endraw %} {% raw %}{{relative comment_created}}{% endraw %}:</p>
                    {% raw %}{{{comment_detail}}}{% endraw %}
                </div>
            {% raw %}{{/each}}{% endraw %}
        {% raw %}{{/if}}{% endraw %}
    {% raw %}{{/each}}{% endraw %}
    ...
</div>

```

<a name="conclusion"></a>
## 4.2.4. Conclusion

So we created a package from the ground up and linked it with a controller. A
package can be accessed programmaticall, by browser, or command line. In the
next chapter we will be covering the **Storm ORM** in
[4.3 Intro to Storm](./4.3.-Intro-to-Storm-ORM.html).
