The caller trait profiles meta information about the current method and the
method that called it. Mounting this trait can be done with the following
example.

```php
use Cradle\Profiler\CallerTrait

class MyClass
{
    use CallerTrait;
}
```

The caller trait adds on two method to your class called `getCaller` and
`getCallee`. The following shows how these method can be used.

```php
$this->getCaller(); //--> ['file', 'line', 'class', 'method' ...]
$this->getCallee(); //--> ['file', 'line', 'class', 'method' ...]
```


<a name="#inspector"></a>
## 6.3.2. Inspector

The inspector trait profiles class properties in certain stages. Mounting
this trait can be done with the following example.

```php
use Cradle\Profiler\InspectorTrait

class MyClass
{
    use InspectorTrait;
}
```

The inspector trait adds on just one method to your class called `inspect`
which can be used in various ways. The following shows how this method can be
used.

```php
//echo MyClass->protectedProperty
$this->inspect('protectedProperty');

//echo MyClass->protectedProperty after `someMethod` was called
$this->inspect('protectedProperty', true)->someMethod();
```
