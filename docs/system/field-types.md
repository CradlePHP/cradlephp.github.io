It is possible to define some parts in the mask as optional. This is done by
using `[]` as in `(99) 9999[9]-9999`.

The above example will allow values like `(99) 99999-9999` or `(99) 9999-9999`.
Dynamic masks can change during the input. To define a dynamic part use `{}`.

 - `{n}` => n repeats
 - `{n|j}` => n repeats, with j jitmasking
 - `{n,m}` => from n to m repeats
 - `{n,m|j}` => from n to m repeats, with j jitmasking

Also `{+}` and `{*}` is allowed. `+` start from 1 and `*` start from 0.
