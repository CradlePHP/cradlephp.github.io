# 3.1. Services & Settings

 - [3.1.1. Services](#services)
 - [3.1.2. Settings](#settings)

Services and settings can both be found in the `config` folder under
`config/services.php` and `config/settings.php` respectively. These files are
the starting point for setting up your server/s and customizing your application.

## 3.1.1. Services

Services are an OPS list of arbitrary service connection information needed to
integrate with the system. You are free to add or remove more services as per your
particular project. Services get processed in `bootstrap/services.php`. This
code was intentionally left in the root layer *(as opposed to a vendor package)*
to encourage you to update as your project needs.

Out of the box, the system supports the following services and all that is
required is you enter their credentials.

###### Figure 3.1.1.A. config/services.php
```php
return [
    'sql-build' => [
        'host' => '<DATABASE HOST>',
        'user' => '<DATABASE USER>',
        'pass' => '<DATABASE PASS>'
    ],
    'sql-main' => [
        'host' => '<DATABASE HOST>',
        'name' => '<DATABASE NAME>',
        'user' => '<DATABASE USER>',
        'pass' => '<DATABASE PASS>'
    ],
    'elastic-main' => [
        '<ELASTIC HOST:PORT>'
    ],
    'redis-main' => [
        'scheme' => 'tcp',
        'host' => '127.0.0.1',
        'port' => 6379
    ],
    'rabbitmq-main' => [
        'host' => '127.0.0.1',
        'port' => 5672,
        'user' => '<RABBIT USER>',
        'pass' => '<RABBIT PASS>'
    ],
    's3-main' => [
        'region' => '<AWS REGION>',
        'token' => '<AWS TOKEN>',
        'secret' => '<AWS SECRET>',
        'bucket' => '<S3 BUCKET>',
        'host' => 'https://<AWS REGION>.amazonaws.com',
        'root' => '<ROOT PATH IN BUCKET OR REMOVE THIS>'
    ],
    'mail-main' => [
        'host' => 'smtp.gmail.com',
        'port' => '587',
        'type' => 'tls',
        'name' => 'Project Name',
        'user' => '<EMAIL ADDRESS>',
        'pass' => '<EMAIL PASSWORD>'
    ],
    'captcha-main' => [
        'token' => '<GOOGLE CAPTCHA TOKEN>',
        'secret' => '<GOOGLE CAPTCHA SECRET>'
    ]
];
```

As a practice, Cradle uses fallback logic when a service is not defined. The
only service that is truly required is `sql-main`.

```info
INFORMATION: We will go through each of the services in detail in later chapters.
```

```info
INFORMATION: Any service with a value starting with `<` will not process and be
ignored using fallback logic.
```

```danger
DANGER: For security purposes, don't commit your services.php file
```

This services file has two kinds of services called generic and special services.

### 3.1.2.1. Generic Services

Generic services can be defined arbitrarily on the fly.

###### Figure 3.1.2.1.A. Accessing a Generic Service
```php
$service = cradle('global')->service('captcha-main'); //-> array
```

### 3.1.2.2. Special Services

Instead of raw arrays, special services like `sql`, `elastc`, `redis`, and
`rabbitmq` attempt to load up a library that makes using these respective
services easier. The following code shows how to retrieve these services and the
classes they respectively return.

###### Figure 3.1.2.2.A. Accessing Special Service Objects
```php
$sql = cradle('global')->service('sql-main'); //-> PDO
$index = cradle('global')->service('elastic-main'); //-> Elasticsearch\ClientBuilder
$cache = cradle('global')->service('redis-main'); //-> Predis\Client
$queue = cradle('global')->service('rabbitmq-main'); //-> PhpAmqpLib\Connection\AMQPLazyConnection
```

If you need to get the raw array configurations for a service, you can do so
using the `config` method as shown below.

###### Figure 3.1.2.2.A. Getting Raw Configuration of Service Objects
```php
$sql = cradle('global')->config('services', 'sql-main'); //-> array
$index = cradle('global')->config('services', 'elastic-main'); //-> array
$cache = cradle('global')->config('services', 'redis-main'); //-> array
$queue = cradle('global')->config('services', 'rabbitmq-main'); //-> array
```

### 3.1.2.1. Special Service Libraries

Specifically, the following items outline the libraries used per special service.

 - SQL - [PDO Manual](http://php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php)
 - ElasticSearch - [ElasticSearch PHP](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-php)
 - Redis - [PRedis](https://github.com/nrk/predis)
 - RabbitMQ - [PhpAmqpLib](https://github.com/php-amqplib/php-amqplib)

```danger
DANGER: Changing these class requirements will break the Cradle's core packages.
It's recommended to create your own service keys as well as case for them in
bootstrap/services.php manually.
```

## 3.1.2. Settings

Settings are used to control the settings between environments. Specifically,
it allows to have a setup designed for a developer environment and for production
*(live)* environments.

```warning
WARNING: Since production settings can be different from developer settings,
it is probably not a good idea to commit this file.
```

###### Figure 3.1.2.A. config/settings.php
```php
return [
    'home' => '/',
    'debug_mode' => E_ALL,
    'environment' => 'dev',
    'error_email' => '<EMAIL ADDRESS>',
    'i18n' => 'en_US',
    'name' => 'Custom Project',
    'server_timezone' => 'GMT',
    'log_path' => 'log',
    'theme_color' => 'theme-default',
    'theme_layout' => 'theme-left',
];
```

While the above settings are designed for a development setup, the following
table shows the recommended settings for a production environment.

###### Figure 3.1.2.B. Production (Live) Settings

**debug_mode** | `0`
**environment** | `'production'`

Settings also control the look and the feel of the admin. The admin has six color
themes you can choose from out of the box.

 - `theme-default`
 - `theme-blue`
 - `theme-red`
 - `theme-dark`
 - `theme-purple`
 - `theme-orange`

Additionally, the admin front end code was structured for different layouts out
of the box. The following items are possible theme layout options.

 - `theme-left` - Menu positioned on the left
 - `theme-top` - Menu positioned on the top
