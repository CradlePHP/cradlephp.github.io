# 3.5. Setting Up the Cache

Caching can happen in three flavors.

 1. Caching a database call or result set
 2. Caching a template block
 3. Caching an entire page

Cradle uses a cache to deal with *a database call or result set*. Caching is
usually volatile, in that we cannot rely that the data will always exist
*(persistent)* in a cache. But overall using a cache is the fastest way to
retrieve data none the less because it does not compute anything to return data.
It just looks for a key and returns its value.

###### Figure 3.5.A. config/services.php
```php
...
'redis-main' => [
    'scheme' => 'tcp',
    'host' => '127.0.0.1',
    'port' => 6379
]
...
```

```info
INFORMATION: there isn't anything you need to do after a cache is configured. It
should just work.
```

If you need to truncate data from Redis you can do so with the following
commands.

###### Figure 3.6.D. Truncating the cache
```bash
$ bin/cradle redis flush
$ bin/cradle redis flush --schema profile
```
