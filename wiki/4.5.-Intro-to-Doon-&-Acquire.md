# 4.5. Intro to Doon and Acquire

 - [4.5.1. Doon](#doon)
 - [4.5.2. Acquire](#acquire)

For the admin, Cradle relies on two main JavaScript libraries **Doon** and **Acquire**.
While it's not required to use these in your front end, it's still important
to be aware of their existence.

<a name="doon"></a>
## 4.5.1. Doon *(Do On)*

**Doon** is a super light weight event driven container. Since most of the
**Schema Fields** are using by [Doon Interfaces](./4.C.-Reference-Doon-Interfaces.html),
we should basically understand the basic premise in case we would want to use the
exact same fields in the front end.

The following is a basic **Doon** implementation

```html
<div data-do="trigger" data-on="click|mouseover|mouseout"></div>
```

The reason it is called Doon is because there are two things typically required
`data-do` and `data-on`. The following JavaScript can be used to bind functionality
to the above HTML.

```js
$(window).on('trigger-init', function(e, target) {
  $(target).html('Click Me');
}).on('trigger-click', function(e, target) {
  $(target).css('color', 'red');
}).on('trigger-mouseout', function(e, target) {
  $(target).css('color', 'blue');
  $(target).css('font-size', '12px');
}).on('trigger-mouseover', function(e, target) {
  $(target).css('font-size', '20px');
});

$('div').doon()
```

With **Doon** there is an obvious pattern change when we code the JavaScript
which is we don't specify the selector to listen to. This is nice if ever we
need to change the HTML, we don't need to change the JavaScript.

Now the **Doon Library** is not written to be complicated
*(in fact, the source code is only [44 lines](https://github.com/cblanquera/doon/blob/master/doon.js))*.
`/public/scripts/www.js` has a predefined list of **Doon Interfaces** that you
can use on the Front End *(also `/public/styles/www.css` has the interface styles)*.

Now a lot of these **Doon Interfaces** uses third party libraries and wrap it as
a **Doon** because it introduces consistency between libraries. For example in
`/public/scripts/www.js` we can describe the **Mask Field** as the following.

```js
$(window).on('mask-field-init', function(e, target) {
    $.require(
        'components/inputmask/dist/min/jquery.inputmask.bundle.min.js',
        function() {
            var format = $(target).attr('data-format');
            $(target).inputmask(format);
        }
    );
});
```

The code above includes the third party library when it needs it using `$.require()`.

<a name="acquire"></a>
### 4.5.2. Acquire

The `$.require()` is an alias for the **Acquire Library** which is a lightweight
*AMD* `require()` script and file loader with caching.

###### Usage
```js
require('/application/bar.js');
```

#### Pre-Loader

Set up a preloader so you can use it like require in Node JS.

```js
require.load(
    '/application/bar.js',
    '/application/template.html',
    '/application/circle2.js',  
    '/application/circle1.js');
```

You can also directly define the paths as in:

```js
require.load({
    '/application/bar.js': function() {
        return 'foo';
    },
    '/application/template.html': '<h1>Yay</h1>',
    '/application/circle2.js': function() {
        console.log('circle-2');
    },  
    '/application/circle1.js': 'eval;require('%2Fapplication%2Fcircle2.js')()%3Bmodule.exports%20%3D%20function()%20%7B%09console.log('circle-1')%3B%7D'});
```

This is the recommended way when you are ready to bundle and minify your code for production use. As you can see `/application/circle1.js` is compiled different than the others. This is because there is some other code outside of the `module.exports`. If you have this same case wrap your entire file using `encodeURIComponent`. Acquire will evaluate strings that start with `eval;` following the encoded code.

If you need to wait for the pre loaders you can include a callback at the end of the load method as in:

```js
require.load(
    '/application/bar.js',
    '/application/template.html',
    '/application/circle2.js',  
    '/application/circle1.js',
    function(bar, template, circle2, circle1) {
        require('/test.js');
    });
```

###### Path Configuration
```js
require.config({
    application: {
        root: '/application',
        index: 'foobar'
    },
    foobar: '/foobar'
});

require('application/bar'); // will now be the same as require('/application/bar.js')
require('application/bar/'); // will now be the same as require('/application/bar/foobar.js')
require('foobar/bar'); // will now be the same as require('/foobar/bar.js')
require('foobar/bar/'); // will now be the same as require('/foobar/bar/index.js')
```

```warning
Warning: Relative paths like require('application/bar') with no config will default to require('/node_modules/application/bar.js')
```
